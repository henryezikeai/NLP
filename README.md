### Based on your analyses, what should someone do (or not do) if they want to make a highly-rated movie?
**High rated movies**
- Originality is key. Highly rated movies were fresh and realistic enough to be relatable or believable.
- Characters were well-developed, with depth and layers that make them likeable and memorable.
- The plot is engaging, with a balance of tension, relief, and emotional depth.
  
**Low rated movies**
- Used low level cinematography, sound and pictures.
- Low rated movies used the same storyline over and over againand characters were so unrealistic or one-dimensional that they detract from the story.
